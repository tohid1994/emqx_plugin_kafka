Hello,

Iâ€™m encountering an issue with loading the Kafka plugin in EMQX. When attempting to start the Kafka plugin, I receive the error: parse_config_file_failed.

Steps Taken:

Added emqx_plugin_kafka.conf to /opt/emqx/etc/plugins/.
Configured the file as per documentation.
Set file permissions to -rw-rw-r--.
Restarted EMQX.
Despite these steps, the error persists. Could you please advise on a solution or provide insights into the possible cause?

Additional Information:

Thank you for your assistance.
